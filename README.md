# Final-Project-CS2
This repository contains Group 4 Dahlia's final project for CS2.

Planned Features
The program will:
1. Show which books are still borrowed (Not Yet Returned).
2. Count how many books a user has checked out.
3. Total the number of books borrowed overall (Regardless if returned or not).
4. Show books that are overdue in return (Assuming 14 day return window).
5. Show the most popular books during a period of time.
