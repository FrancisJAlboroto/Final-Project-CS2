## 🔍 Problem Statement   
- Libraries are a great feature in schools, providing free reading materials and resources. But it may be difficult to keep track of borrowing patterns, overdue returns,
and book availability, leading to lost and unreturned textbooks. This problem brings a disadvantage to other students, and difficulty in understanding which subjects or
books are in high demand. The dataset selected contains student borrowing records in the library, containing details like borrower ID, student name, book titles, and borrow
and return dates. By analyzing this dataset, it allows us to identify the students' borrowing trends, track overdue books, and analyze the high demand books.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Write at least **2–3 clear objectives** your project aims to achieve. Example:  
- Objective 1: To analyze and summarize data from the chosen JSON dataset.  
- Objective 2: To help users gain meaningful insights (e.g., averages, trends, patterns).  
- Objective 3: To practice JSON handling and Python programming concepts.

## ⚙️ Planned Features  
Your program must have **at least 5 features (minimum)**.  
We have provided **2 starter ideas** for each dataset — you must design **at least 3 additional features**.  

- Feature 1: *(Starter idea)*  
- Feature 2: *(Starter idea)*  
- Feature 3: *(Your own idea)*  
- Feature 4: *(Your own idea)*  
- Feature 5: *(Your own idea)*  

*(You may add more features if you like.)*

## ⌨️ Planned Inputs and Outputs  

- **Inputs**  
  - What kind of data will the user provide (if any)?  
  - Example: student ID, date range, product name  

- **Outputs**  
  - What kind of results will your program display?  
  - Example: class averages, top products, weather summary

## 🧠 Logic Plan  
Choose **ONE** way to describe your program’s logic:  

### Option 1: Pseudocode  
Write your steps in plain English. Example:  
Load JSON file
Display menu of features
If user chooses "1", compute average grade per student
If user chooses "2", list all borrowed books
Repeat until user exits program


### Option 2: Flowchart  
Attach or draw a flowchart showing how the program will work.
