# 📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

## 📝 Project Title  
BookTrack: Library Borrowing Data Analyzer 

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Libraries are a great feature in schools, providing free reading materials and resources. But it may be difficult to keep track of borrowing patterns, overdue returns, and book availability, leading to lost and unreturned textbooks. This problem brings a disadvantage to other students, and difficulty in understanding which subjects or books are in high demand. The dataset selected contains student borrowing records in the library, containing details like borrower ID, student name, book titles, and borrow and return dates. By analyzing this dataset, it allows us to identify the students' borrowing trends, track overdue books, and analyze the high demand books.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Objective 1: To use the data provided and start off by seeing how many books are currently being borrowed and to check how many books one borrower has checked out, with other features to be developed.
Objective 2: To make a conclusion about a certain pattern after analyzing the data.
Objective 3: To fully understand how JSON is used in different areas, such as a library.

2. Count how many books a user has checked out
3. Total the number of books borrowed overall
4. Find specific items by title or author
5. Identify which student has borrowed a specific book (Title or Author)
